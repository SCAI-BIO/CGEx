# CGEx
CGEx (Cypher Generating Expert), a system that enables users to interact with a COVID-NDD comorbidity knowledge graph using simple natural language questions. CGEx translates these questions into Cypher queries, retrieves relevant data from the graph, and generates detailed natural language explanations based on the query results.
